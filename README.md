## Notes from the maker
This game was started on in the early 2012 when I began learning PHP. Since then, I've been programming on and off as I felt like it, making it into my hobby when I had nothing else to do.

## Updates

### 30.03.2025
It's been five years and the code hasn't been maintained at all. There's some minor adjustments to protocol (http/https) handling for offline coding. Removed some unused code and comments. More will be done possibly.
Todo: Fix biltyveri.php and look through all scripts for a possible complete overhaul.

### 07.03.2020
Slowly but surely making scripts that will help with the setup of the game instead of having to do a lot of manual work to get things running on new systems.

### 09.01.2020
Setting up PDO to replace MySQLi methods and to secure the script further.
